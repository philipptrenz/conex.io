The conex.io API provides the functionality to interact with home automation devices, which are connected to a home automation server, detached from the manufacturer specific communication syntax.

This is a prototypical implemementation for the home automation server [FHEM](https://fhem.de/).

## Overview  

conex.io provides a simple but powerful API interface to equip your smart home server with a growing pool of not only mobile applications.

This is a first prototype implemented in Java using the SpringBoot framework with bindings for the open source server [FHEM](https://fhem.de/).

## Helpful notes

This server was partly generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project. 

The underlying library integrating swagger to SpringBoot is [springfox](https://github.com/springfox/springfox)  

You can view the api documentation in swagger-ui by pointing to
