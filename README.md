The API uses `jsonlist2` and the longpoll mode `websocket` to connect to your FHEM installation.
Therefor define a new FHEMWEB device, set attributes `longpoll` to `websocket` and `csrfToken` to `none`.

* Open `/src/main/java/resources/application.properties` and configure url, port and credentials (optional) to your FHEM installation
* Run with `mvn spring-boot:run`

## Helpful notes

The underlying library integrating swagger to SpringBoot is [springfox](https://github.com/springfox/springfox)  

You can view the api documentation in swagger-ui by pointing to  http://localhost:8080/v0/
